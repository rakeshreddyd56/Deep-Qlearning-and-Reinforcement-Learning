# Deep-Qlearning-and-Reinforcement-Learning

This codebase delves into the fascinating world of Reinforcement Learning by exploring various techniques such as policy iteration, value iteration, and Q-learning on diverse OpenAI environments through the gym python library. Additionally, the codebase seeks to investigate the performance of deep Q-Learning algorithms when compared to traditional methods.

The application of Deep Q-Learning is a key focus in this project, with the algorithm being deployed on various OpenAI environments, including CartPole and MsPacman. The CartPole environment is particularly interesting as it is used to test the convergence speed of the DQN architecture. Through extensive experimentation, this project aims to provide valuable insights into the potential of Reinforcement Learning to tackle complex real-world problems.
